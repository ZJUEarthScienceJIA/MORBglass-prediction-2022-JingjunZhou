# Structure
+ **datasets**: It contains the dataset **"dataset2"** consisting of global MORB glasses with complete major and tracements but lack of experimentally measured water contents.
+ **models**: It contains the established machine learning model **"Established_RFR_model.pkl"**.
+ **results**: It contains the predicted results produced by the code in **"MORB_water_prediction_code.ipynb"**.
+ **"MORB_water_prediction_code.ipynb"**: The code for predicting unknown samples by using the model **"Established_RFR_model.pkl"**.
